          <h2 class="blog-post-title">His story</h2>
          <p class="blog-post-meta">January 27, 2022: <a href="#">Márton</a></p>

          <p>(竈門 炭治郎 Kamado Tanjirō?) a Demon slayer is the main protagonist of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. He is a
            Demon Slayer in the Demon Slayer Corps, who joined to find a remedy to turn his sister, Nezuko Kamado, back
            into a human and to hunt down and kill demons, and later swore to defeat Muzan Kibutsuji, the King of
            Demons, in order to prevent others from suffering the same fate as him.

          </p>

          <p> Before he became a Demon Slayer, Tanjiro was a coal burner before his entire family was slaughtered by
            Muzan
            while his younger sister, Nezuko, was turned into a demon.</p>
          <h2>Appearance</h2>
          <p>Tanjiro is a young boy of average height with fairly tanned skin and an athletic, muscular physique. He has
            ruffled, black hair with burgundy tips, combed back to expose his forehead, and wide, dark red eyes with
            white pupils that appear lighter around the lower section of his irises. He also has a scar on the top left
            of his forehead, first seen when his mother brought him to watch his father perform the Hinokami Kagura
            dance.</p>

          <h3>Personality</h3>
          <p>Tanjiro is very kind by nature and has been described by others as having very gentle eyes and a
            compassionate persona. He exhibits a great deal of determination and will not give up once he has a goal to
            achieve; the best example of this being his relentless quest to find a cure for Nezuko. Even though he is
            relatively strong on his own, Tanjiro isn't opposed to asking others for help when he needs it. He is very
            protective of his friends and even more so of his younger sister. However, despite his kind and
            understanding nature, Tanjiro does have a limit to his tolerance and has a distaste for rudeness and
            cowardice as he easily becomes annoyed by Zenitsu Agatsuma's constant whining, and angered by Inosuke

            “ 	
In order to soothe the spirits of those it killed, and to make sure it claims no further victims... I will swing my blade down and lop off the head of any demon without mercy! But... I will not belittle those who regret their actions and suffer over the things they did as demons. Because demons were once human. Because they were like me. 	”
  	
— Tanjiro Kamado's ideology about demons in To Hell
